# Warfront: My final project for CSCI 5229 Computer Graphics course


## Introduction

I am trying to create a scene, where a bunch of tanks, a bunch of planes, a bunch of soldiers, are trying
to protect a building and they have to destroy it. It is difficult, especially the textures, the realism,
but hey, atleast I am trying. Wish me luck throughout the project. I need tremendous motivation as I suffer
from anxiety disorder. Wish me luck friends 




## Goals

1. To make stuff look as authentic as possible

2. To add as much as detail as possible

3. To make things look real

4. To add some music if possible

5. To make it bright and colorful and to add to make the user feel
